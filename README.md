## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
### Four of my favorite apps and why:
#### Brilliant
##### Brilliant comes with a user friendly interface, which is crucial because it makes the learning easier. I love the integration of small programs that allows the user to simulate what would be a real world situation or a coding program.
#### Stellarium
##### Amazing space app, it rotates with you with the phones gyroscope pointing you in the right direction of the object you are trying to observe. It is a simple app that also allows you to search whatever star you would like to look for and like a GPS it directs you to that object. Its recalibration tool is perfect in case there are any offsets between the phone and sky.
#### Next Spaceflight
##### This app keeps me up to date with space flights happening around me and around the world. I enjoy the app giving me push notifications of flights happening in real time. The developers managed to fit everything you need to know about a ship/flight into one single page with the liftoff times, photos, and even a google maps of it. I would go here before Google to learn about a flight because all the information has been neatly fit into the app.
#### Strong Workout Tracker
##### All in one fitness tracker and guide. Two of my favorite features would be having the digital workout log where it lets me put all the information from weights to sets to reps. Then the exercise list they provide for those who want to learn a workout it will show a description and video of the exercise being performed. Very useful for beginners. I also enjoy the Apple Watch implementation. Instead of checking off the completed sets on my phone I can use the watch, which also includes the timer and an alert for the next exercise.

## Notes
I was having issues with the following command. I typed it out myself but an error appeared saying that there was no "backgroundcolor". I tried copy paste and it ended up working. It turns out I've spelled '~~backround~~' 'background' wrong my whole life.
```
let randomColor = changeColor()
    view.backgroundColor = randomColor
```
## Idea for app
I've always wanted to make some sort of fitness tracker app, just like the one I mention above 'Strong Workout Tracker'. People used to use pen and paper when logging their workouts, but now that there is a more convenient way of doing it, I would like to publish my own version of it. A simple yet effect and functioning workout log app with Apple Watch and Music Services support. The goal is to help the user not have to leave out of the app at all when working out or using it on their watch. Now with the expanding evolution with AI, I would like the chance to also try to implement it into my app to serve as a sort of support (not medical advice) for those who have quick questions about a certain exercise or science behind a workout. It would save the user the lengthy google search and video.
